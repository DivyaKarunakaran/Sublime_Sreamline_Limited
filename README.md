Developed a responsive website using PHP5 (CodeIgniter – Open Source Framework), JavaScript Libraries (Jquery and amChart), Bootstrap3, AJAX, HTML5 and CSS3.

To run the project:

1)	Use these links to download the server as per your OS

	https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html - XXAMP
	http://www.wampserver.com/en/ - WAMP

	https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer - LAMP
	https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/ - MAMP

2)	Install WAMP/ XXAMP for windows, MAMP for MAC and LAMP for Linux users
3)	Configure PHP 5.x.x (I have used PHP 5.6.30)
4)	Require internet access to run libraries

Features: 

1)	Displays the list of servers as dropdown lists (using http request )
2)	Once a particular server is selected, website displays the line graph (amChart) for its values (AJAX call sent to the server to read the values)
